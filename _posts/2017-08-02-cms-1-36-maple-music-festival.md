Sorry for the lack of updates! Unfortunately, there were some concerns with the OneDrive download folder last year. As a result, I can no longer provide direct downloads to the music. However, I will continue to upload new MapleStory songs onto YouTube as they are released through official channels.

To catch up with all the missing content, I'll begin posting the newer songs that have yet to be featured on this site.

Here's the music from the Maple Music Festival, which made its debut last year.
